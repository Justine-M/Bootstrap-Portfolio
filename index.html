                  <p>
                    I was born in Philadelphia, PA and I attended the Philadelphia High School for Girls and later graduated from Stony Brook
                    University AKA as SUNY Stony Brook with a B.S. degree in Chemistry. Some of my interests include watching
                    movies and different television shows. My favourtie movie is Rebecca, although ironically I have not
                    read the book yet. I am not going to lie I watch alot of shows and I cannot keep them all straight. Superman
                    is my favourite superhero and my second is Black Panther since I love cats, especially black cats. I've
                    always wanted a black cat. Speaking of cats I have one named Barry Allen and he is satirically almost
                    completely white. As an avid food lover I love trying out different foods from different cultures.

                        Right now I am trying to be the best person I can be. People think I have a bubbly personality, but sometimes I can be a
                        bit judgemental. I've been to southern California once and since then I've wanted to move there.
                        The weather there is amazing and I've always wanted to move someplace that has beaches. I love to
                        read blogs just to read peoples different perspectives on multiple issues. Somethings involve seeing
                        the whole picture. I've always wanted to learn coding and programming. I think it is such an interesting
                        tool to learn especially now when eveything we do is digitized and computerized. It almost feels
                        like a necessity now and days.
