            I was born in Philadelphia, PA and I attended the Philadelphia High School for Girls and later graduated from Stony Brook
            University AKA as SUNY Stony Brook with a B.S. degree in Chemistry. Some of my interests include watching movies
            and different television shows. My favourtie movie is Rebecca, although ironically I have not read the book yet.
            I am not going to lie I watch alot of shows and I cannot keep them all straight. Superman is my favourite superhero
            and my second is Black Panther since I love cats, especially black cats. I've always wanted a black cat. Speaking
            of cats I have one named Barry Allen and he is satirically almost completely white. As an avid food lover I love
            trying out different foods from different cultures.

              Right now I am trying to be the best person I can be. People think I have a bubbly personality, but sometimes I can be a
              bit judgemental. I've been to southern California once and since then I've wanted to move there. The weather
              there is amazing and I've always wanted to move someplace that has beaches. I love to read blogs just to read
              peoples different perspectives on multiple issues. Somethings involve seeing the whole picture. I've always
              wanted to learn coding and programming. I think it is such an interesting tool to learn especially now when
              eveything we do is digitized and computerized. It almost feels like a necessity now and days.
